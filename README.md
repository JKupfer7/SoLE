# SoLE
 Simulation of Local Epidemics Using Graphs

SoLE creates, based on values put in by the user, a population and then simulates an epidemic in said population. This epidemic is also based on the values put in by the user.

When first opening the application, there is an option to connect to a previously created databse, to create a new one or to show some sample data.

The "projects" tab is where the population is first initialized. The attributes of both population and disease can be entered under "details of selected project". "Simulation Setups" shows the current population. The duration and number of times the epidemic is to be simulated can be entered under "Simulations".

The tab "tasks" contains the steps necessary to simulate the epidemic. They can be executed seperately or all at once.

"Results" shows the final results of the simulation.
